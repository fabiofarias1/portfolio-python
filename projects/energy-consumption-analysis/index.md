# ⚡ Energy Consumption Analysis

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project explores the power consumption behavior of a household over time. It uses real data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption) to extract insights into how energy is consumed and when it peaks.

The goal is to identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities for energy efficiency.

---

## 📊 Key Questions

- How does energy usage vary throughout the day, week, and year?
- Are there specific peak usage hours?
- Can we detect seasonal or temperature-based patterns?
- Are there signs of energy inefficiency or waste?

## 🧪 Dataset

- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- Data period: December 2006 to November 2010  
- Frequency: 1-minute interval  
- Size: ~2 million rows  
- Features: Global Active Power, Voltage, Sub-metering data, etc.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data cleaning & transformation
- Time series analysis
- Visual storytelling

---

## 🔍 Summary of Findings

_(To be filled after completing the project — some example points below)_

- Energy consumption peaks between 6 PM and 9 PM.
- Voltage tends to drop slightly during high-consumption periods.
- Sub-metering 1 (kitchen) has lower variation than Sub-metering 2 (laundry room).
- Weekends show a flatter usage pattern compared to weekdays.
